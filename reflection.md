## Reflection Document

### HTML

In addition to my familiarity with a few THML references, such as MDN Web Docs and W3Schools, I have been using the lectures in class to help me along the way.  My comprehension of semantic HTML and the significance of employing meaningful tags to organize material was strengthened by these resources.

### Accessibility

Accessibility was a key focus in this exercise. I used semantic elements such as <header>, <main>, and <section> to help screen readers and assistive technologies better interpret the page structure. I avoided generic link text like “Click here,” instead opting for more descriptive labels. I also ensured that forms have labels and that the layout adjusts for various screen sizes to support accessibility across devices.

### CSS
For styling and layout, I relied heavily on Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes. Bootstrap made it much easier to create responsive designs without writing a lot of custom CSS. I learned how to use classes like .container, .row, and .col-md-* to build layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. I also explored Bootstrap components such as cards, navbars, and buttons, and learned how to customize them by combining utility classes and a small amount of custom CSS.
